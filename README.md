Material for an interactive tutorial on version control with git.
Currently only contains a few introductory slides, since most of
the content was delivered in a hands-on way with walk-through
exercises. The slides can be viewed online [using nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/format/slides/github/maxalbert/GitTutorial/blob/master/slides/git_tutorial_slides.ipynb)
